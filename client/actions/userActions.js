// Possible Ideas For User Actions - I am thinking these are agnostic from registration and signup
// 'SET_USER_SESSION' - Maybe we can have registration + signup utlize this after API is hit

// I think a good idea for this action creator as well is to basically utilize thunk to retrieve and set our session details within our browser using
// other actions maybe from userActions.js
